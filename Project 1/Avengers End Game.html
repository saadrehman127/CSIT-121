<h1>Avengers Endgame is one of the best movies of all-time</h1>

<p>
Avengers Endgame came out in 2019 and it was a big hit in the marvel cinematic universe. The movie nearly made 2.7 million dollars and had a budget of 356 million dollars. This movie was the second part of the Avengers infinity war saga. When the audience found out about the release date of this movie tickets were sold out months beforehand. Thankfully I was able to get my hands on tickets on the official release date. This is one movie no Marvel fan can ever forget about since it has nearly almost every single superhero you can think of. The avengers had a tough decision to make in this movie. It has been nearly 5 years since Thanos wiped out half the population on earth. The avengers had a chance to bring back everyone but it came with risks. Avengers went on to time travel to recover the infinity stones and bring back everyone who was gone. Time travel comes with risks and they encounter Thanos the villain from the past. This brought an insane battle at the end of the movie where all marvel fans went crazy. The battle was one to never forget. I've nearly watched this movie about 1000 times and it still feels like I'm watching it for the first time. If you haven't watched this movie yet please go and do so!

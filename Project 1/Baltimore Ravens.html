<p>I grew up in Baltimore my entire life. I've been watching the Ravens since I was 9 years old. I remember going to a game and watching Ed Reed and Ray Lewis playing on the field. Those two players are now in the hall of fame. I've been a big ravens fan forever now. I watch every single game no matter if I'm at work or if I'm out somewhere else. Seeing the organization grow and bring in new talent is great. I got to see Lamar Jackson and his team practice in their facility. We had a rough start to our season but I know we will pick it up for sure and go win the super bowl.</p>

<footer>This is my favorite recipe because I love eating pizza. My favorite topping on a pizza is chicken tikka as well. Chicken tikka adds a lot of flavor to the pizza and gives a good taste. You will enjoy the recipe I created for my specialty pizza. Everyone that has tried my pizza falls in love with it and always wants me to make more.
